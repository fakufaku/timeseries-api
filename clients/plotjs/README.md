Plot from timeseries-api
========================

A simple example of using [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/)
to plot data one of the timeseries. The timeseries id is hard-coded for now
and JQuery is used to recover the data from the API in JSON format.

Note that most browser will not let the script run if the API is not running
on the same server.
